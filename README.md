# ffxiv-crafting-guide
This is an automatic crafting rotation generator for ffxiv, written in C++.

## Introduction
Given your character status and recipe info, it'll automatically figure out an available(perhaps) rotation.
If it fails to find a proper rotation, there'll be some advice for you (only two pieces at present :D).

## User Guide
Open ffxiv-crafting-guide.exe, follow the instructions and you'll get the result.

## Limitations
1. There's no GUI yet.
2. The only languages supported are English and Simplified Chinese.
3. One can only let the rotation start with "Muscle Memory", "Reflect" and "Inner Quiet".
4. The character level is ignored and set to lvl80 at present. Manipulation is automatically learned.


There are definitely a lot of bugs, and I sincerely welcome all kinds of issues and advice ;)
